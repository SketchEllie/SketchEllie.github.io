						Seek Coffee is a logo project created for a hypothetical business. The project first began with the idea of Seek Coffee. Taking into consideration aesthetic and feel for the hypothetical business, I created 10 different iterations of potential logos. Some handdrawn and some made in a software. After creating the logos, Peers reviewed the designs and picked out the ones they liked best; one they felt had a good design and fit the aesthetic I was going for with the business.

					<p style="margin-top: 45px;">
						From there I honed in on the designs people liked most and expanded on them more. I combined some logos from the first iterations, improved a few others and kept some of the logos the same that people felt were good. The first set of designs were creative, but the second set were a lot cleaner than the first batch. Once again I had peers reflect on these logos and discuss what they liked about the logos. In the end, majority of my peers liked one design and wanted to see how I could expand on that particular logo.

						From the one logo, I worked around the design by changing around a lot of the design choices. switching to different font styles, playing with the kerning, messing around with the tilt/skew of the logo, and trying out different styles with the same base logo. I even tried out some "dark mode" versions of the logo. In the end I settled with a design that was pretty close to the original, altered a bit in some parts, cleaning up other parts of the logo and adding a surronding border to encase the entire thing.
