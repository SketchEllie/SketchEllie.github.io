				<h1>
				A BIT ABOUT ME
				</h1>
				<p>
				My name is Ellie Ly and I am an Asian-American artist based in NYC with a focus on storytelling through visual mediums.
				<br><br>
				I strongly believe that narrative is one of the most powerful tools you can use in order to connect with your audience and share your message with them. Everything has a story behind it, how it's come to be, its purpose in life and the journey to come. There's so much to learn from the world and I want to be a part of telling those stories. 
				<br><br>

				<br><br>
				I enjoy getting lost in the world during my past time, whether its through enjoying other stories, exploring nature and traveling the world, and living vicariously through others in their journey. 
				I graduated from New York University Tandon School of Engineering in May 2020 with a B.S. Degree in Integrated Digital Media.
